# Get Building

Realms.World L3 works the same as Starknet with a key difference.

### Fee Token

The designated Fee token in the world is the Lords Token, which means you will need to have some of these Lords available.

You must have this in your balance to deploy a contract, call a contract, or do anything on the network.


#### The Fee Token Architecture

The Lords token on the network is a dojo specific erc20 token. This allows us to use the token natively within the dojo framework! Pretty slick...

[insert flowchart of how this works]


#### Implications of this when developing

You need to consider how the token is used. 


## Create an Account and Get some Lords

We will be doing three steps to get started developing on the Realms.World L3 network.

1. Create Account Details
2. Get some Lords from the Faucet
3. Deply Account
4. Setup your Scarb.toml


#### 1. Create Account Details

There are many ways to create an Account on a Starknet network, and the ability to do this will be baked into the dojo cli framework, however as of this writing this is not available so we need to use a script to do this.

Clone this scripts repo [here](https://github.com/dojoengine/world-scripts).

Note: You will need to install [bun](https://bun.sh/) in order to run these scripts.

Run the script and it will output your account details like:

```bash
bun run create.ts
```

```bash
ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=0x42b41d1fe426f14338067f14eacccb0590eeca87bff037c000f87e8174b3e06
ACCOUNT_PUBLIC_KEY=0x2bc7bdbd128140f75c24728b55767b106a1e88bb408fd7f5727c93eaa8bc714
ACCOUNT_ADDRESS=0x737d34811ee5f77ae95a50c152bcb47c64a3dc03939ec0a3d86b1d1d53caf31
```

Now `source .env` and you will have these variables available to you for the next step.


#### 2. Get some Lords from the Faucet

Head to [realms world faucet](https://realms-world-alpha-faucet.preview.cartridge.gg) and paste in your account address from the previous step and it will send you some Lords!

##### 2a. Confirm your balance

You can confirm your balance by running the following command:

```bash
bun run balance.ts
```

#### 3. Deploy Account

Now that you have some Lords in your account, you can deploy your account to the network.

```bash
bun run deploy.ts
```

#### 4. Setup your Scarb.toml

You will need to setup your Scarb.toml file to point to the Realms.World L3 network.

```toml
[package]
cairo-version = "2.4.0"
name = "realms_world"
version = "0.5.1"

[cairo]
sierra-replace-ids = true

[dependencies]
dojo = { git = "https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo", tag = "v0.5.1" }

[[target.dojo]]

[tool.dojo]
initializer_class_hash = "0xbeef"

[tool.dojo.env] // [!code focus]
rpc_url = "https://api.cartridge.gg/x/realms/katana/" // [!code focus]

# Your details you just created
account_address = "<>" // [!code focus]
private_key = "<>" // [!code focus]

# World address (optional if you want to deploy to the cannonical world)
world_address = "<>" // [!code focus]
```
